  <h1>Mt. Samat, Bataan</h1>
  <p>
    Mt. Samat is a tall mountain located in Bataan. On top of this mountain, there is a very big cross called the Shrine of Valor. This place was built to remember the brave soldiers who fought for the Philippines a long time ago. The mountain has many trees and the air feels very cool. There is also a museum where you can see old things from the war. It is a very important place for the country because it shows how much people love their land.

  <p>
    I want to visit Mt. Samat because <strong>I want to see the giant cross and learn about history</strong>. I want to ride the elevator to the top of the cross and look at the sea and the green trees from high above. It is a good place to visit with my friends to say thank you to the heroes of the past. I want to walk around the park and feel the fresh wind. I think it is important to visit places that have a great story to tell.
