  <h1>Boracay Island</h1>
  <p>
    Boracay is a small island but it is very famous for its white sand. The sand is so soft that it feels like powder on your skin. The water is very blue and you can see your feet when you stand in it. During the day, the sun makes the water sparkle. At night, there are many lights and people eating dinner by the beach. There are many coconut trees that lean towards the sea. It is a very happy place where many people go to enjoy their vacation.

    I want to visit Boracay because <strong>I want to swim in the clear water and walk on the white sand</strong>. I want to see the beautiful sunset while sitting on the beach. I also want to try fun water sports like riding a banana boat or a sailboat. I want to eat delicious food like grilled fish and mango shakes. I think it is the best place to relax and forget about school for a while. It looks like a paradise where everyone is smiling.
