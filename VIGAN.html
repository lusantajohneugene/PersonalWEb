  <h1>Vigan City</h1>
  <p>
    Vigan is a very old city in Ilocos Sur. It is special because the houses look like they were built many years ago. The streets are made of big stones and no cars are allowed in some areas. Instead of cars, you can see horse carriages called kalesas. The windows of the houses are made of shells called capiz. It is a very quiet and beautiful city. People visit Vigan to see how Filipinos lived during the Spanish time. It is a city that feels like a big museum.

    I want to visit Vigan because <strong>I want to ride a kalesa and see the old houses</strong>. I want to walk on the stone streets and buy some souvenirs made by the local people. I also want to try the famous food like empanada and bagnet. I want to take pictures of the street at night because the yellow lights make it look very magical. I like learning about the past and Vigan is the best place to do that. It will be a very cool trip.
