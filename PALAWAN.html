  <h1>Palawan</h1>
  <p>
    Palawan is a very large and beautiful island in the Philippines. It is famous because it has a very long river that flows underground inside a dark cave. The water in Palawan is very blue and very clean. You can see big rocks made of limestone standing in the middle of the ocean. There are many hidden beaches that you can only reach by boat. It is a place where nature is protected and everything looks very green and fresh.

    I want to visit Palawan because <strong>I want to go on a boat and see the hidden lagoons</strong>. I want to swim in the clear water and see the colorful fish and corals under the sea. I also want to ride a small boat inside the underground river cave to see the amazing rock shapes. It looks like a very peaceful place to explore with my family. I want to take many photos of the big mountains and the blue sky because it is like a dream.
