  <h1>Banaue Rice Terraces</h1>
  <p>
    The Rice Terraces are located high up in the mountains of Ifugao. They look like giant green stairs made of land. A long time ago, people built these terraces using only their hands and simple tools. They did this so they could plant rice on the side of the mountain. It is very green everywhere and the air is very cold and fresh. There are also many waterfalls and rivers nearby. It is called the "Eighth Wonder of the World" because it is a very amazing thing that humans made.

    I want to visit the Rice Terraces because <strong>I want to see the giant green stairs and hike the mountains</strong>. I want to see how the farmers work in the fields and learn about their culture. I want to feel the cold air on my face and listen to the sound of the birds. It is a very peaceful place away from the noisy city. I want to see this beautiful place because it shows how hard work can create something wonderful. It will be a very big adventure for me.
